               Ensoniq SQ-80 Patch Editor and Librarian
               ----------------------------------------

This is a simple patch editor and librarian for Ensoniq's SQ-80 synths.

To compile, you require the following:

 NetBSD or Linux
 GTK 3
 PortMidi

You also require a MIDI interface that is supported by NetBSD or Linux.

While developing the current version of this program, I used the
following:

 NetBSD 9
 Debian 10
 Akai EIE MIDI interface
 Ensoniq SQ-80
